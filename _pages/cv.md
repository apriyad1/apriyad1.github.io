Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, 2026 (expected)
* Integrated M.Sc. (B.S.+ M.S.) in Mathematics, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, 2016


Work experience
======
* Winter, 2023 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant
  * ETAD Lab, UCI
  * Duties includes: My research focuses on advancing fairness and interpretability in Machine Learning, particularly through fair representation learning and explore neuro-symbolic AI frameworks such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), and Large Language Models (LLM). Currently, I am exploring the fairness and interpretability aspects of these models to enhance transparency and trustworthiness in decision-making processes. Additionally, I leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like FairGAN model as the state-of-the-art baseline models to evaluate and mitigate bias while ensuring equitable outcomes. My work includes developing fairness-aware deep learning methods within the domain of student admissions, utilizing real-world datasets obtained through NDAs with Universities. I also work on developing mathematical modeling and guarentees to improve model performance, reliability, and efficiency. My technical expertise spans Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), PyTorch, and CUDA for GPU-accelerated computations, enabling scalable and effective implementation of deep learning frameworks.

  * Supervisor: Prof. Sergio Gago-Masague

* Fall 2022 - Fall, 2023: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Dept. of Computer Science, UCI
  * Duties included: We worked on deep symbolic regression techniques using reinforcement learning algorithm which uses the policy gradient concept to produce mathematical expression(s) in the form of a syntax tree which is generated stochastically. The work focuses on improving the reward function through optimization technique by simultaneously improving the learning algorithm through noisy data inputs.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Eric Mjolness
